        <p>My name is Ania Kubow and I am a Software Developer during the day who loves to teach code through building retro Games and awesome projects in the evening. I am also part of the core team @ FreeCodeCamp. You can find me putting out videos on there, as well as on my own channel every Wednesday (and sometimes an extra one during the week too)!
            Born in Poland and raised in the UAE, I graduated from Dubai College majoring in Math, Physics and DesignTech before moving to the UK to attend University. I have worked as a Financial Derivatives Broker in Singapore and London in a past life, and as a Software Developer in my most recent years.</p>
